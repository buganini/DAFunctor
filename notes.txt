Consider an operation as
    dst = Func(src)
    or
    dst[Didx] = Func(Sidx)

Trial 1:
    for Didx in idx_in(dst):
        Sidx = I(Didx)
        dst[Didx] = F(Sidx)

    Pros:
        * intuitive for simple constructive functions
    Cons:
        * needs branch in loop for data combining functions like stack()

Trial 2:
    blocks = src splitted by data branches
    for block in blocks:
        for Sidx in idx_in(block):
            Didx = J(Sidx)
            dst[Didx] = F(Sidx)
    Pros:
        * no branch in loop
    Cons:
        * unable to construct 1-Sidx to n-Didx functions like repeat()
